== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin create new roles in order to apply them to customers? =

No, this plugin doesn't create roles. You have to create them first. However, you can select multiple roles per each user in the Edit User page.

= A customer made an order, which should trigger one rule, but the customer didn't gain any role. What's happening? =

Customers gain the roles when the order gets the "processing" or "complete" status. Maybe the customer paid via Check Payments, so you have to change the status manually.

= Do the roles grant discounts? =

It depends on the rules you have configured for each role. YITH Automatic Role Changer only assign roles to users. The power of this plugin consists of being used with other plugins in order to configure the roles according to the expected behaviour.
